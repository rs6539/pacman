"Pacman" is a classic arcade game where the player controls a character
navigating a maze-like environment, collecting dots while avoiding
ghosts. In this project, we explore the application of artificial intelligence
(AI) techniques, specifically search algorithms, to develop intelligent
agents capable of playing Pacman autonomously. The primary objective
is to design agents that efficiently navigate the maze, collect the maximum
number of dots, and evade or outsmart the pursuing ghosts.
We implement various search algorithms, including uninformed search
algorithms such as breadth-first search (BFS), depth-first search (DFS),
and iterative deepening depth-first search (IDDFS), as well as informed
search algorithms like A* search and its variants, to guide Pacman's
actions within the game environment. Each algorithm is evaluated based
on criteria such as solution quality, computational efficiency, and
optimality.
Overall, this project demonstrates the utility of AI search techniques in
developing intelligent agents for playing Pacman, offering insights into
the challenges and opportunities inherent in applying search algorithms to
real-world gaming environments. The findings contribute to the broader
field of AI and gaming, with implications for both entertainment and
practical applications in areas such as robotics, autonomous navigation,
and decision-making under uncertainty.
